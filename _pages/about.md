Hi! I am Jiayi Zhou, a CS research assistant at Hong Kong Baptist University working with [Prof. Kaiyang Zhou](https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/). 

Prior to that, I was a Master student of [social computing lab](http://www.morimo.com/morimo-ken/index.htm) at Hiroshima University, advised by [Prof. Yasuhiko Morimoto](https://seeds.office.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/profile/ja.426195b7887509fc520e17560c007669.html), [Prof. Sayaka Kamei](https://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/s10kamei/j-index.html) and [Prof. Koji Eguchi](https://seeds.office.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/profile/ja.08fe4c07c0bb6d6b520e17560c007669.html), and I obtained my B.S. from Beijing University of Chemical Technology.

My current research is on Memory efficient learning and its applications. I am also broadly interested in topics like Diffusion Models and LLMs.
